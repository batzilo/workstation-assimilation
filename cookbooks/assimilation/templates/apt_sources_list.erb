# See wiki.debian.org/SourcesList and wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting.
#
# To use testing:
#
# * start from the current stable
#
# * edit your apt sources, changing 'stable' or the current codename for stable
#   to 'testing'
#
# * remove stable security updates apt sources (anything with
#   security.debian.org in it)
#
# * remove any other stable-specific apt sources, like *-backports or *-updates
#
# * remove the *-security repository because it is empty, see
#   wiki.debian.org/Status/Testing#Security
#
# * add contrib non-free after main
#
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian testing main contrib non-free
