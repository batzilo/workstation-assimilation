# Be aware that udev does not support any form of line continuation.
# Do not insert any line breaks in your rules, as this will cause udev
# to see your one rule as multiple rules and will not work as expected.
#
# udev does not run these programs on any active terminal, and it does
# not execute them under the context of a shell.
